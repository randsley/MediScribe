MediScribe – Clinical Overview

Overview

MediScribe is a clinical documentation support tool designed to assist healthcare professionals working in rural, remote, and low-resource settings.

Its purpose is to reduce documentation burden while maintaining clear clinical safety boundaries and human oversight.

What MediScribe Does
    •    Supports structured clinical notes
    •    Generates descriptive summaries of visible image features
    •    Assists with referral documentation
    •    Operates fully offline on iPhone and iPad

⸻

What MediScribe Does NOT Do

MediScribe does not:
    •    Provide diagnoses
    •    Interpret clinical significance
    •    Recommend treatments, investigations, or management
    •    Replace clinical decision-making

All outputs are observational and descriptive only.

Imaging Support – Clinical Boundaries

When imaging is used, MediScribe:
    •    Describes visible features (e.g., symmetry, presence or absence of obvious features)
    •    Uses neutral, non-probabilistic language
    •    Applies a fixed output structure
    •    Includes a mandatory limitations statement

MediScribe does not:
    •    Name diseases or conditions
    •    Assess severity or urgency
    •    Compare findings to diagnostic criteria
    •    Suggest next steps, referrals, or management

⸻

Human-in-the-Loop Requirement

All generated content:
    •    Is presented as a draft
    •    Must be reviewed by a clinician
    •    Cannot be saved or shared without confirmation of review

This ensures MediScribe functions as a documentation assistant, not an autonomous clinical system.

⸻

Use in Low-Resource Settings

MediScribe is designed to:
    •    Function without internet connectivity
    •    Operate on battery-powered devices
    •    Avoid reliance on cloud services or external accounts
    •    Support task-shifting environments while maintaining safety boundaries

⸻

Clinical Responsibility

Clinical responsibility remains entirely with the healthcare professional using MediScribe.

MediScribe is a support tool only and should be used in accordance with local clinical guidelines, scope of practice, and professional judgment.

⸻

Summary

MediScribe supports documentation, clarity, and communication — not diagnosis or clinical decision-making.
